# odesolve

Author: Willis Sanchez-duPont

Solve ordinary differential equations.

Contains a single class for solving and animating ODES. ODESolver.py contains this class and uses functions defined in odesolve.py to solve and potentially animate differential equations. Currently, any ODE of the form xdot = f(t,x) can be solved, however ODESolver is only capable of animating and visualizing solutions to 3D differential equations.
